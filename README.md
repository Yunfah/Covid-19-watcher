## Covid-19 watcher 
A project with React to track the developments of Covid-19

First thing to do is to install the node_moudles package. Without it the project will not work.
One solution is to create a react app using `npx create-react-app [name of project]` and then take the node_modules from there and past it into this project. The git.ignore file is used to ignore this file from being pushed up.
The second thing to do is to install these other modules, you can use npm to do it.
`npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap`
`npm install react countup`


# To start project do `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
